      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The publication is intended for service providers who wish to be
          recognized by the Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) as a Credential
          Issuer in the OCI interoperable environment.
          <br><br>
          This document specifies the Conformance Criteria for a <b>Credential Issuer</b>. For a general introduction to OCI, please refer to our <a
        href="https://open-credentialing-initiative.github.io/getting-started/">Getting Started guide </a> or <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">the Open Credentialing Initiative website.</a>

      <section>
        <h2>Role of Credential Issuer</h2>
        <p>
          While gathering information about an organization
          <a>ATP</a>
          status is relatively simple, ensuring that an
          <a>ATP</a>
          credential is being granted to the right entity, and not to an
          imposter, is more difficult. ATPs are subject to licensing at either the state or federal level, and the statuses of
          those licenses are a key gating feature of gaining ATP status. These licenses or registrations have a public component,
          which is both a benefit and a curse. While establishing that a given ATP exists is a requirement of credential issuance,
          the greater challenge is to validate an individual's claim to be that ATP's representative. By performing thorough and
          auditable due
          diligence, a Credential Issuer promotes confidence in a Trading
          Partner’s digital identity prior to the issuance of an
          <a>ATP</a>
          Credential. The Identity Credential becomes the
          <a>Root of Trust</a>
          upon which an ATP Credential can be issued.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, the Root of Trust could be instantiated on a higher level by establishing a body that certifies the
          Credential Issuers, and then issues verifiable credentials to them. As there are very few Credential Issuers in the
          initial phase of OCI, such a process is not necessary. OCI uses the DID:web method for the Credential Issuers as this is
          a method built upon proven, well-known instruments. The initial OCI implementation includes a registry with the names
          and DIDs of vetted Credential Issuers that have demonstrated and proven adherence with the OCI Credential Issuer
          Conformance Criteria.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Purpose of Conformance Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of this publication is to communicate Conformance
          Criteria. Conformance Criteria establish the trusted processes that
          are to be followed for an organization to be recognized and accepted
          by OCI as a Credential Issuer. This ensures interoperability among all
          OCI-compliant service providers.

        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>
          The following keywords indicate the precedence and general rigidity of
          a given conformance criterion, and are to be interpreted as:
        </p>
        <li>
          <b>SHALL</b> and <b>SHALL NOT</b> indicate strict requirements from which no
          deviation is permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SHOULD</b> and <b>SHOULD NOT</b> indicate preferred approaches; among several
          possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without
          mentioning or excluding others, but is not necessarily required, or
          that (in the negative form) a certain course of action is discouraged
          but not prohibited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MAY</b> and <b>NEED NOT</b> indicate possible and permissible approaches that are
          not necessarily preferred.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CAN</b> and <b>CANNOT</b> indicate a capability, whether material, physical or
          causal or, in the negative, the absence of that capability.
        </li>
        <p>Keywords appear in <b>bold</b> and ALL CAPS in the Conformance Criteria.</p>

            <dfn><abbr title="Authorized Trading Partner">ATP</abbr></dfn>
            (Authorized Trading Partner): The Drug Supply Chain Security Act
            (DSCSA) restricts access to the distribution system for prescription
            drug products by requiring that trading partners of manufacturers,
            wholesale distributors, dispensers, and repackagers meet the
            applicable requirements for being Authorized Trading Partners.
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            includes definitions for authorized and trading partner with respect
            to manufacturers, repackagers, wholesaler distributors, third-party
            logistics providers (3PLs), and dispensers. For example: “To be
            considered an authorized trading partner, a wholesale distributor
            must have a valid license under State law or section 583 of the FD&C
            Act, in accordance with section 582(a)(6) of the FD&C Act, comply
            with the licensure reporting requirements in section 503(e) of the
            FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, and accept or transfer direct
            ownership of a product from or to a manufacturer, repackager,
            wholesale distributor, or dispenser.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Credential</dfn>
            : A digital assertion containing a set of claims (e.g., about a
            state license or FDA Establishment Identifier) made by an entity
            about itself or another entity. Credentials are a subset of identity
            data. The entity described by the claims is called the subject of
            the credential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Credential Service Provider">CSP</abbr></dfn>
            (Credential Service Provider): An entity that issues verifiable
            credentials. Also known as a Credential Issuer.

          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Drug Supply Chain Security Act">DSCSA</abbr></dfn>
            (Drug Supply Chain Security Act): An act of the U.S. Congress that
            mandates an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace
            certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United
            States. The DSCSA imposes a number of current and emerging
            requirements on pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders as part of
            a mandate to protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be
            counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Identity Assurance Levels">IAL</abbr></dfn>
            (Identity Assurance Levels): A category defined by NIST that conveys
            the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is
            their real identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Identity Proofing</dfn>
            : The process by which a
            <a>CSP</a>
            collects, validates, and verifies information about an entity.
          </li>
          <li>

              <abbr title="National Institute of Standards and Technology">
                NIST
              </abbr>
            </dfn>
            (National Institute of Standards and Technology): An agency that is
            part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Congress established the
            agency in 1901 to build a measurement infrastructure and establish
            standards for a wide range of products and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Relying party">RP</abbr></dfn>
            (Relying party): An entity that requests credentials from a
            secondary entity in order to verify that the secondary entity is
            authorized to complete an attempted transaction. Of the Credential
            Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, the relying party is normally the
            Verifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Root of Trust">RoT</abbr></dfn>
            (Root of Trust): A source that can always be trusted within a
            cryptographic system. A cryptographically verifiable chain of trust
            from any point in the system leads back to this source. Within the
            OCI ecosystem, the Identity Credential is the RoT upon which
            issuance of
            <a>ATP</a>
            Credentials depends. The due diligence expected of the Credential
            Issuer is established by OCI, and this due diligence must be
            exercised prior to issuing an Identity Credential.

        Issuers desiring to participate in
        <a>DSCSA</a>
        initiatives that were designed, tested, and proven by OCI can begin by
        understanding and embracing the underlying open standards for credential
        formatting (W3C) and identity proofing (
        <a>NIST</a>
        ). While neither is specified by statute or FDA guidance,
        <a>NIST</a>
        is a division of the US Department of Commerce and a trusted FDA
        partner, and W3C is an internationally recognized standards body. These
        standards serve as anchoring points for the OCI to establish an identity
        ecosystem that is fit for purpose.

        <h2>W3C Standards for Credential Formatting</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>About (W3W)</h2>
          <p>
            The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community
            where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work
            together to develop Web standards. One of the many standards put forth
            by the consortium establishes generally accepted formats for
            verifiable credentials. The abstract from the W3C website Verifiable
            Credentials Data Model page states:
          </p>
          <i>
            “Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used
            to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university
            degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and
            government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries.
            This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of
            credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure,
            privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.”

          <h2>Credential Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Working groups at the W3C author, host, and maintain the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model 1.0 specification.
            This W3C VC Standard is now a W3C recommendation (the most mature stage of the W3C standards process). Verifiable
            credentials (VCs) are issued against identifiers that may be associated with cryptographic operations, be they DIDs,
            self-certifying identifiers, or legacy identities backed with traditional PKI. The structure of a VC is an important
            component of interoperability.
          </p>
          <p>
            OCI relies on an implementation of a common standard for the credential structure. Credential Issuers <b>SHALL</b>
            implement Verifiable Credential Data Model 1.0.
          </p>
          <p>
            At time of writing, there are only early, non-standard and experimental implementations that combine traditional PKI
            with VCs and DIDs. Therefore Credential Issuers <b>SHALL</b> implement DIDs as cryptographic identifiers. It <b>SHALL</b> be
            understood that DIDs can be blended with X.509 within the Identity Verification Process in the form of wrapped or
            nested
            credentials.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Credential Serialization & Schemas</h2>
          <p>
            Credentials that are issued by the Credential Issuer are created in accordance with the W3C JSON-LD format for schema
            serialization. To ensure processing, validation, and interpretation of verifiable credentials by different implementers,
            JSON-LD schemas for Identity and ATP credentials are introduced. Credential Issuers <b>SHALL</b> support the JSON-LD format and
            JSON-LD schema validation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Credential Issuers <b>SHALL</b> have mechanisms in place to support multiple valid versions of credential schemas endorsed and
            published by OCI. Such a mechanism will allow handling transition periods when new credential schema versions are
            released and the industry has to adopt changes to schemas. It shall be understood that there can be multiple active
            schema versions; decommissioned and revised versions can have an expiration date. Decommissioned schema versions <b>SHALL</b>
            return an error by the ATP credential verification API.
          </p>
          <p>
            The OCI <b>SHALL</b> document and publish a list of approved (active), revised, and decommissioned versions of the Identity and
            ATP Credential schemas on https://github.com/Open-Credentialing-Initiative. Credential Issuers <b>SHALL</b> follow the schema
            requirements published by OCI for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital Wallet Providers <b>SHALL</b> support the OCI approved credential schema for processing, validation and
            interpretation that are published on the OCI Github for the Identity Credential and the DSCSA ATP Credential.
          </p>
          <h2>Outlook</h2>
          <p>
            GS1 maintains a web vocabulary which is designed to extend the work done by schema.org and make use of similar concepts
            (Product, Offer, Organization), extending them with many more details. As the definitions defined in the vocabulary are
            already used in attributes of GS1 B2B messages and EPCIS events, OCI is working with GS1 to normalize the definitions of
            the OCI credential schemas.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future, OCI may decide to move the credential schemas to a GS1 schema repository (e.g. GS1 web vocabulary on
            Github). To be consistent with GS1 requirements, OCI might want to introduce further validation instruments such as
            SHACL. If and when these changes happen, Credential Issuers SHOULD support the GS1 schema repository and the SHACL

          The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was founded
          in 1901 and is now part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. One of the
          nation's oldest physical science laboratories, NIST was established by
          Congress to remove a major challenge to U.S. industrial
          competitiveness. One of the many standards put forth by NIST
          establishes generally accepted methods for a CSP to prove the identity
          of a subject. The full set of standards can be found in
          <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">

          <h2>
            <a>Identity Assurance Levels</a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <a>NIST</a>
            defines three different levels of assurance regarding identity.
            These standards can be found in
            <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">
              Section 4 of
              NIST Special Publication 800-63A. 
            </a>
            The level chosen by a
            <a>CSP</a>
            is based on the requirements of the specific use case. The three
            levels are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1) – There is no requirement to
              link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any
              attributes provided in conjunction with the subject’s activities
              are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted (including
              attributes a
              <a>CSP</a>
              asserts to an
              <a>RP</a>
              ). Self-asserted attributes are neither validated nor verified.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) – Evidence supports the
              real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the
              applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world
              identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or
              physically-present identity proofing. Attributes could be asserted
              by
              <a>CSPs</a>
              to
              <a>RPs</a>
              in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3) – Physical presence is required
              for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by
              an authorized and trained
              <a>CSP</a>
              representative. As with IAL2, attributes could be asserted by
              <a>CSPs</a>
              to
              <a>RPs</a>
              in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A
              <a>CSP</a>
              that supports IAL3 can support IAL1 and IAL2 identity attributes
              if the user consents.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Broadly speaking, under OCI all Credential Issuers are required to achieve both a minimum standard of due care as well
            as perform vigilant checks on revocable events. While technological progress and human ingenuity are difficult to
            predict, some approaches are clearly inadequate – a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Self-reporting is
            clearly inadequate, and excessive gathering of weak evidence creates unnecessary risk for stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            In principle, the evidence to support a credential should be strong (secret information that only a valid applicant
            would have), verifiable (difficult and risky to falsify), and minimal (the minimum number of secrets to transfer, hold,
            and verify).
          </p>
          <p>
            IAL1, the lowest level of identity proofing, is not appropriate for
            the
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            use case.
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            regulations specify that you must confirm that the trading partner
            is authorized. Failure could result in penalties including fines,
            imprisonment, and/or suspension or revocation of licenses. If the
            identity of the trading partner is self-asserted, then even if a
            <a>CSP</a>
            goes to an official source to check licenses or registrations for
            “authorized trading partner” status, that status would also be
            considered as self-asserted because it is based on a self-asserted
            identity. Therefore, one cannot confirm whether the party on the
            other end of a
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            transaction is an
            <a>ATP</a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            IAL2, the mid level of identity proofing, is suitable as an
            anchoring point for
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            requirements. Details are included in the next Section.
          </p>
          <p>
            IAL3, the highest level of identity proofing, is a higher degree of
            assurance that far exceeds
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            requirements. It would come at a substantially higher price, which
            is unnecessary for the
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            use case.

          standards are written to a broad variety of use cases, and therefore
          do not specify particular evidence needed under the DSCSA use case.
          Section 5.2.1 of the <a>NIST</a> publication contains helpful information on how to assess the strength of identity evidence.
          For example, a strength of SUPERIOR requires, among other things, that:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>
              The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by
              following written procedures designed to enable it to have high
              confidence that the source knows the real-life identity of the
              subject. Such procedures are subject to recurring oversight by
              regulatory or publicly accountable institutions.
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              The evidence contains a biometric template (of any modality) of the
              person to whom it relates.      
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>
              The evidence includes digital information, the information is
              protected using approved cryptographic or proprietary methods, or
              both, and those methods ensure the integrity of the information and
              enable the authenticity of the issuing source to be confirmed.
            </i>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A strength of STRONG requires, among other things, that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity through written procedures designed to enable it to
              form a reasonable belief that it knows the real-life identity of the person. Such procedures are subject to recurring
              oversight by regulatory or publicly-accountable institutions.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The issued evidence contains a photograph or biometric template (of any modality) of the person to whom it relates OR
              the applicant proves possession of an AAL2 authenticator, or equivalent, bound to an IAL2 identity, at a minimum.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Where the issued evidence includes digital information, that information is protected using approved cryptographic or
              proprietary methods, or both, and those methods ensure the integrity of the information and enable the authenticity of
              the claimed issuing source to be confirmed.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The above bullet points are just a few excerpted examples to illustrate subtle differences between identity strengths.

          Because the

          publication does not delineate particular evidence for the

        <h2>Examples of the Use of One Piece of Strong Evidence</h2>
        <section>
          <h2>DEA Signing Certificate</h2>
          <p>
            Use of the DEA Signing Certificate alone meets the
            <a>NIST</a>
            standard of “One piece of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence” for Identity
            Assurance Level 2 (IAL2). The Credential Issuer
            validates the evidence directly with the issuing source through the
            certificate itself, which is a set of encrypted codes generated by the
            issuing source (DEA), which cannot be modified or replicated by another
            party. In addition, misrepresentation of a DEA Signing Certificate is
            a prima facie offense where no further fraud, misrepresentation, or
            unauthorized access is needed for the authorities to pursue action
            against an offender. It's one thing to lie to a [=Credential=] Issuer,
            but it's an entirely different level of risk to steal a DEA number.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DEA Signing Certificate not only validates the existence and
            identity of the organization, but also validates the identity and authority
            of the representative. It is therefore the quickest and simplest
            method for complete identity proofing. Nothing from this point on in
            this Section 4 on Evidence for
            <a>Identity Proofing</a>
            is required if the DEA Signing Certificate is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            The DEA reassures registrants that the use of the DEA Signing
            Certificate is perfectly acceptable for this purpose; it was foreseen
            and specifically allowed for by the DEA in their policy manual

                relevant to environments where risks and consequences of data
                compromise are moderate. This may include transactions having
                substantial monetary value or risk of fraud, or involving access
                to private information where the likelihood of malicious access is
                substantial.

          <h2>National Provider Identifier</h2>
          <p>
            Use of the NPI registration alone meets the NIST standard of “One piece of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence” for Identity
            Assurance Level 2 (IAL2). The Credential Issuer validates the evidence directly with the issuing source (National
            Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP)) by retrieving the registration information from the NCPDP database.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NPI registration not only validates the existence and identity of the organization, but also provides evidence
            toward validation of the identity and the authority of the representative. There is still a need to validate that the
            applicant representing the organization is the same person that is listed in the NPI registration. This step is covered
            in Section 4.5.

        <h2>Examples of the Use of Multiple Pieces of Strong or Fair Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          If an organization does not have a singular qualifying superior or strong identify evidence, the alternative is for them
          to gather
          and submit offical documents to the
          <a>CSP</a>
          to prove the existence and identity of the organization. In addition, the
          applicant representing the organization must submit documentation to prove
          their individual identity, as well as their authority to act on behalf
          of the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMPORTANT NOTE: Simply collecting documents or identification numbers
          does not constitute identity proofing. Due diligence is required to
          thoroughly validate the collected documents and identification
          numbers.

          <p>
            As specified in
            <a>NIST</a>
            SP800-63A section 4.4.1.6, the
            Credential Issuer
            <b>SHALL</b> validate the organization's address. The mailing address and phone
            number <b>MAY</b> be considered validated and confirmed (as address of record) by the processes in
            section 4.4.1 above if the address from one of those sources
            matches the address on the corporate document(s) submitted by the
            applicant. If they match, then the phone number (if available) from the
            above-mentioned sources(s) can be considered as reliable as the
            mailing address for communication purposes. The ability to
            communicate with the applicant via phone (as opposed to mailing
            address) can expedite the identity proofing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the company name and address of record cannot be verified through
            one of the sources listed in 3.4.1, then the
            Credential Issuer
            <b>SHALL</b> request from the applicant a copy of a recent (no more than 3
            months old) bank statement, utility bill, industry trade publication
            / letter, or other official piece of business mail that displays the
            organization’s name and address. The mailing address from this document
            <b>SHALL</b> become the address of record. Note that this process does not
            allow a phone number to be verified as part of the address of
            record; thus, later steps of the due diligence process <b>SHALL</b> be
            transacted via mail, and <b>SHALL NOT</b> be transacted via phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way to expedite the communication process is to use a
            verified email address. This can be accomplished if the applicant
            has an email address within the organization’s domain, and the
            Credential Issuer
            can reasonably ascertain that the domain belongs to the organizations
            through one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the domain registration record is accessible and the owner

            </li>
            <li>

              address; or
            </li>
            <li>
              If the applicant provides a link to a page on the organization’s
              website where the displayed organization name and address (and phone
              number if present) match the address of record (see above)

          <h2>Articles of Incorporation</h2>
          <p>
            A copy of the Articles of Incorporation can be viewed online and
            downloaded by anyone inside or outside the organization; therefore, a
            copy of the document that looks exactly like the one on the website
            is considered by
            <a>NIST</a>
            to be WEAK evidence for proving identity because it does not meet
            the following criteria: “The issuing process for the evidence means
            that it can reasonably be assumed to have been delivered into the
            possession of the applicant.” However, a recent scan of the original
            document that looks slightly different (coloration, positioning of
            pages, and the like) from the one on the website would indicate that
            the original document is in the hands of the applicant, and it could
            qualify as STRONG depending on other factors, such as the name and
            address of the organization’s “Registered Agent” on the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            The [=Credential=] Issuer <b>SHALL</b> go to the Secretary of State’s (or
            other authority’s) website and retrieve the publicly available copy
            of the document to compare it with the one submitted by the
            applicant. If the applicant IS also the Registered Agent, then this
            document would qualify as one STRONG piece of evidence even if the
            document looks like it was simply downloaded from the website. If
            the applicant is someone other than the Registered Agent, then this
            would still qualify as one STRONG piece of evidence if it looks
            authentic (not just downloaded from the website) and the address
            matches the applicant’s address. Otherwise it would be considered a
            FAIR piece of evidence as long as the address matches. If the
            address doesn’t match, then it would be considered WEAK and unusable
            as evidence.

          <h2>IRS Employer ID Number (EIN) Letter</h2>
          <p>
            The original EIN letter (form CP 575) was mailed by the IRS to the
            address specified on the application form SS-4, and is not
            downloadable from a website. Therefore, it would be quite difficult
            for someone not associated with the organization to get a copy of this
            document. An organization can get a replacement (147c letter) by knowing
            the EIN, name and address of business, and phone number of business;
            if the contact info has not changed since the original application
            for the EIN, the IRS will mail or fax it to the original contact. If
            the contact info has changed, you must file form 8822. Thus, it is
            reasonable to conclude that either the CP 575 copy or the 147c copy
            meets the following criteria: “The issuing process for the evidence
            means that it can reasonably be assumed to have been delivered into
            the possession of the applicant.”.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the document is faxed to the [=Credential=] Issuer from a fax
            number that matches the fax number on the document, it would qualify
            as one STRONG piece of evidence. If the document is uploaded, it
            would qualify as one STRONG piece of evidence if the address matches
            the applicant’s address. If the address doesn’t match, then it would
            be considered WEAK and unusable as evidence.

            A business license or permit, a notice from the IRS, or some
            official paperwork from a bank where the organization opened an account
            might also have the organization’s EIN on it. Such documents could be
            evaluated for consideration as FAIR evidence for proof of identity
            if the EIN Letter itself cannot be provided.

          the BOP-issued license status. (Manufacturers are not subject to this
          check, as the FDA does not provide a “status” for FDA Establishment
          Identifier (FEI) Registrations.) This check <b>SHALL</b> include querying the
          most recent possible version of the regulatory board’s data source.
          Some boards refresh their data as frequently as daily, but none
          refreshes their data less frequently than monthly. Therefore, the
          License Status query <b>SHALL</b> be against BOP data that is no more than
          one month old.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the License Status is not interpreted to be “Active”, the organization’s
          application for ATP credential <b>SHALL</b> be further scrutinized to
          determine if the ATP credential can be issued. Subsequent scrutiny and
          the basis of any decision <b>SHALL</b> be documented as part of the audit
          trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: With 150+ different assigned statuses across the state
          regulatory bodies (such as boards of pharmacy, etc.) the state
          regulatory bodies can communicate what is considered “Active” among
          the simple, straightforward statuses as well as more complex statuses
          that are subject to interpretation.

        </ol>
        <p>
          In the future, exceptions might be added. For example, a well-known
          corporation with many license locations <u>PASSES</u> all of the below
          checks:
        </p>
        <ul>

      <section>
        <h2>General Requirements</h2>
        <p>A Credential Issuer <b>SHALL</b>:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use a digital wallet to enable cross-solution interoperability.
          </li>

          <li>
            Use either the DIDComm Messaging v2 or the vc-http-api method for requesting from or issuing Identity and ATP credentials to a trading partner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide an OCI-endorsed revocation mechanism so that relying parties can check the revocation status of a credential. 
          </li>

        <h2>Credential Revocation</h2>
        <p>
          In the future, OCI can potentially support multiple methods for communicating when a credential has been revoked. At the
          current stage, OCI supports a proven revocation management method based on LDAP CRLs. Credential Issuers SHALL implement
          the OCI Directory Service (LDAP) based mechanism for determining if a Verifiable Credential has been revoked
          (vc-status-2021-ldap). 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The LDAP CRL method provides a time stamping feature for recording the credential revocation event time. This is an
            important feature that most of the alternative revocation methods do not provide. This feature is important for post
            transaction audits and investigations.
          </li>
          <li>
            The LDAP approach is less complex to implement than traditional revocation paths, as LDAP is a proven and widespread
            technology which most potential implementers already have experience with.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Digital Wallet Providers are allowed to implement a caching mechanism for credential revocation data to cache LDAP data
          for up to 24 hours. Existing cached data can be used to speed up revocation list checking, and can also be used when the
          OCI Directory Service is not available due to technical / communication issues. Credential revocation data SHALL not be
          older than 24 hours during normal operations of the OCI Directory Service.

        <h2>Identity Credential Monitoring and Expiration</h2>
        <p>
          An Identity Credential <b>SHALL</b> expire one year from the date it is
          issued. The expiration date indicates when the credential is no longer
          monitored, after which it <b>SHALL</b> be considered invalid. During this
          one-year term, the [=Credential=] Issuer <b>SHALL</b> perform continuous
          monitoring (on at least a weekly basis) to identify possible triggers
          for revocation / recertification.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Triggers for Identity Credential Revocation/Recertification</h2>
        <p>
          The following triggers are given a 30 day grace period to be resolved.
          If the issue has not been resolved by the credential’s expiration
          date, the credential will remain valid for an additional 30 days
          before being revoked.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mergers and acquisitions: After a merger / acquisition, the two
            companies may continue to function separately for a period, during
            which there tends to be confusion. An insider could independently
            establish a new “organization” and digital wallet, take the acquired
            organization’s credentials, and operate illegally using the acquired
            organization’s name. This possibility can be avoided by working with the
            acquired organization quickly to revoke the old credentials and issue new
            ones under the merged organization name.
          </li>
          <li>
            Name changes: Check for a name change by comparing the name from the
            source of the original due diligence (Section 3.4 Existence and
            Identity of the Organization - 4.4.1 Organization Name) with the name on the
            Identity Credential. A name mismatch <b>SHOULD</b> trigger a review for
            possible implications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Address changes: Check for an address change by comparing the
            address from the source of the original due diligence (Section 3.4
            Existence and Identity of the Organization - 4.4.2 Organization Address) with
            the address on the Identity Credential. An address mismatch <b>SHOULD</b>
            trigger a review for possible implications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Revocation of other credentials issued by the same [=Credential=]
            Issuer. For example, if the [=Credential=] Issuer who is doing the
            Identity Credential monitoring had also previously issued an ATP
            credential, and that ATP credential has subsequently been revoked,
            it <b>SHOULD</b> trigger a review of the Identity Credential for possible
            implications.
          </li>
          <li>
            Revocation of credentials used by the organization to prove identity
            during the original due diligence. For example, if a DEA Signing
            Certificate was originally used as proof of identity, and the DEA
            subsequently revoked the related DEA license, it <b>SHALL</b> trigger a
            review of the Identity Credential for possible implications.

          [=Credential=] issuance and monitoring activities for a period of not
          less than six (6) years. These detailed records are considered to be
          an audit trail that can be used in the event an investigation is
          conducted into credential-related activities of the credential owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Identity Credential issuance, the audit trail <b>SHALL</b> include copies

          conducting the due diligence to determine the existence and identity
          of the corporation, and the authority of the representative. In
          addition, all notes, decisions, and actions taken by the
          [=Credential=] Issuer as part of the approval process must be captured
          and stored as part of the audit trail. Finally, the digital signature
          of the individual who was responsible for conducting the due diligence
          must be applied to the issued credential to ensure that accountability
          can be tracked to an individual in the [=Credential=] Issuer’s
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Identity Credential monitoring, the audit trail <b>SHALL</b> include
          copies of any documents, or screenshots of any websites, that were
