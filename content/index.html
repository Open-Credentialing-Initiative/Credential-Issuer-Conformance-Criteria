      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
        <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
        <p>
          The publication is intended for service providers who wish to be
          recognized by the Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) as a Credential
          Issuer in the OCI interoperable environment, or for anyone associated
          with the pharmaceutical drug distribution industry who is interested
          in understanding the statutory definitions, regulatory guidances, and
          best practices for establishing Authorized Trading Partner (
          <a>ATP</a>
          ) status under the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).

        <h2>History and Purpose of the Open Credentialing Initiative</h2>
        <p>
          The OCI was formed by a group of industry service providers,
          manufacturers, and wholesalers, and dispensers working together to
          design and deliver an electronic solution for the pharmaceutical
          industry to achieve compliance with FDA mandates for supply chain
          security. Upon successful demonstration of the technical solution, and
          acceptance by the participating manufacturers and wholesalers, the
          participants formed the OCI to further develop the solution into a set
          of tools that could be adopted and implemented across the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name OCI was chosen for the following reasons:
        </p>
        <li>
          Open – Non-proprietary and interoperable. OCI is open to all
          providers, users, and standards organizations that support adoption of
          the integrated W3C standards and applicable NIST identity proofing
          standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Credentialing – A means of providing a credential (similar to a
          license or identity card that you carry in your digital wallet) that
          attests to the identity and status of its owner / holder.
        </li>
        <li>Initiative – Indicates that the work is ongoing.</li>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Regulatory Compliance – Federal Mandates</h2>
        <p>
          The US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) has the objective of
          securing pharmaceutical drug distribution, from manufacturers all the
          way to pharmacies. For patient safety, it is essential to know that
          only trusted and authorized entities are involved in the manufacture,
          distribution, and dispensing of prescription drugs. In addition to
          verification, product tracing, and serialization requirements, each
          supply chain actor must ensure that its Trading Partners are
          authorized (including, in some cases, indirect Trading Partners).
        </p>
        <p>
          DSCSA requires that Trading Partners of manufacturers, wholesale
          distributors, dispensers, and repackagers meet the applicable
          requirements for being “authorized trading partners” (see sections
          582(b)(3), (c)(3), (d)(3), and (e)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C.
          360eee-1); where “authorized” means registration in accordance with
          section 510 (manufacturers and repackagers), or having a valid license
          under State law (wholesalers and dispensers).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Digital Ecosystems - Identity of Transacting Entities</h2>
        <p>
          Verifying that a company is “authorized” is enough to meet the letter
          of the law; however, in digital ecosystems it is also necessary to
          establish the identity of the company. Thus, it becomes a two part
          process – is the counterparty who they say they are, and if so, are
          they “authorized”? To add to this challenge, DSCSA transactions for PI
          Verification and TI Tracing move through any number of intermediaries
          (solution providers, routing systems, etc.) all of whom fall under the
          Statute. In a digital ecosystem it is a matter of good design to limit
          the opportunity for information leaks, transaction replays, and
          tampering with the transaction or credential content throughout the
          ecosystem.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Role of Credential Issuer</h2>
        <p>
          While gathering information about a company’s
          <a>ATP</a>
          status is relatively simple, ensuring that an
          <a>ATP</a>
          credential is being granted to the right entity, and not to an
          imposter, is more difficult. By performing thorough and auditable due
          diligence, a Credential Issuer promotes confidence in a Trading
          Partner’s digital identity prior to the issuance of an
          <a>ATP</a>
          Credential. The Identity Credential becomes the
          <a>Root of Trust</a>
          upon which an ATP Credential can be issued.

        <h2>Purpose of Conformance Criteria</h2>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of this publication is to communicate Conformance
          Criteria. Conformance Criteria establish the trusted processes that
          are to be followed for an organization to be recognized and accepted
          by OCI as a Credential Issuer. This ensures interoperability among all
          OCI-compliant service providers.

            <dfn><abbr title="Authorized Trading Partner">ATP</abbr></dfn>
            (Authorized Trading Partner): The Drug Supply Chain Security Act
            (DSCSA) restricts access to the distribution system for prescription
            drug products by requiring that trading partners of manufacturers,
            wholesale distributors, dispensers, and repackagers meet the
            applicable requirements for being Authorized Trading Partners.
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            includes definitions for authorized and trading partner with respect
            to manufacturers, repackagers, wholesaler distributors, third-party
            logistics providers (3PLs), and dispensers. For example: “To be
            considered an authorized trading partner, a wholesale distributor
            must have a valid license under State law or section 583 of the FD&C
            Act, in accordance with section 582(a)(6) of the FD&C Act, comply
            with the licensure reporting requirements in section 503(e) of the
            FD&C Act, as amended by DSCSA, and accept or transfer direct
            ownership of a product from or to a manufacturer, repackager,
            wholesale distributor, or dispenser.”
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Credential</dfn>
            : A digital assertion containing a set of claims (e.g., about a
            state license or FDA Establishment Identifier) made by an entity
            about itself or another entity. Credentials are a subset of identity
            data. The entity described by the claims is called the subject of
            the credential.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Credential Service Provider">CSP</abbr></dfn>

          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Drug Supply Chain Security Act">DSCSA</abbr></dfn>
            (Drug Supply Chain Security Act): An act of the U.S. Congress that
            mandates an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace
            certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United
            States. The DSCSA imposes a number of current and emerging
            requirements on pharmaceutical supply chain stakeholders as part of
            a mandate to protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be
            counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Identity Assurance Levels">IAL</abbr></dfn>
            (Identity Assurance Levels): A category defined by NIST that conveys
            the degree of confidence that the applicant’s claimed identity is
            their real identity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn>Identity Proofing</dfn>
            : The process by which a
            <a>CSP</a>
            collects, validates, and verifies information about an entity.
          </li>

              </abbr>
            </dfn>
            (National Institute of Standards and Technology): An agency that is
            part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. Congress established the
            agency in 1901 to build a measurement infrastructure and establish
            standards for a wide range of products and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Relying party">RP</abbr></dfn>
            (Relying party): An entity that requests credentials from a
            secondary entity in order to verify that the secondary entity is
            authorized to complete an attempted transaction. Of the Credential
            Issuer, Holder, and Verifier, the relying party is normally the
            Verifier.
          </li>
          <li>
            <dfn><abbr title="Root of Trust">RoT</abbr></dfn>
            (Root of Trust): A source that can always be trusted within a
            cryptographic system. A cryptographically verifiable chain of trust
            from any point in the system leads back to this source. Within the
            OCI ecosystem, the Identity Credential is the RoT upon which
            issuance of
            <a>ATP</a>
            Credentials depends. The due diligence expected of the Credential
            Issuer is established by OCI, and this due diligence must be
            exercised prior to issuing an Identity Credential.

        <a>NIST</a>
        ). While neither is specified by statute or FDA guidance,
        <a>NIST</a>
        is a division of the US Department of Commerce and a trusted FDA

        <h2>W3C Standards for Credential Formatting</h2>
        <p>
          The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community
          where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work
          together to develop Web standards. One of the many standards put forth
          by the consortium establishes generally accepted formats for
          verifiable credentials. The abstract from the W3C website Verifiable
          Credentials Data Model page states:
        </p>
        <i>
          “Credentials are a part of our daily lives; driver's licenses are used
          to assert that we are capable of operating a motor vehicle, university
          degrees can be used to assert our level of education, and
          government-issued passports enable us to travel between countries.
          This specification provides a mechanism to express these sorts of
          credentials on the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure,
          privacy respecting, and machine-verifiable.”

        <p>
          The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was founded
          in 1901 and is now part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. One of the
          nation's oldest physical science laboratories, NIST was established by
          Congress to remove a major challenge to U.S. industrial
          competitiveness. One of the many standards put forth by NIST
          establishes generally accepted methods for a CSP to prove the identity
          of a subject. The full set of standards can be found in
          <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">

            <a>Identity Assurance Levels</a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <a>NIST</a>
            defines three different levels of assurance regarding identity.
            These standards can be found in
            <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">
              Section 4 of
              <a>NIST</a>
              Special Publication 800-63A.
            </a>
            The level chosen by a
            <a>CSP</a>
            is based on the requirements of the specific use case. The three
            levels are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1) – There is no requirement to
              link the applicant to a specific real-life identity. Any
              attributes provided in conjunction with the subject’s activities
              are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted (including
              attributes a
              <a>CSP</a>
              asserts to an
              <a>RP</a>
              ). Self-asserted attributes are neither validated nor verified.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) – Evidence supports the
              real-world existence of the claimed identity and verifies that the
              applicant is appropriately associated with this real-world
              identity. IAL2 introduces the need for either remote or
              physically-present identity proofing. Attributes could be asserted
              by
              <a>CSPs</a>
              to
              <a>RPs</a>
              in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3) – Physical presence is required
              for identity proofing. Identifying attributes must be verified by
              an authorized and trained
              <a>CSP</a>
              representative. As with IAL2, attributes could be asserted by
              <a>CSPs</a>
              to
              <a>RPs</a>
              in support of pseudonymous identity with verified attributes. A
              <a>CSP</a>
              that supports IAL3 can support IAL1 and IAL2 identity attributes
              if the user consents.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            IAL1, the lowest level of identity proofing, is not appropriate for
            the
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            use case.
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            regulations specify that you must confirm that the trading partner
            is authorized. Failure could result in penalties including fines,
            imprisonment, and/or suspension or revocation of licenses. If the
            identity of the trading partner is self-asserted, then even if a
            <a>CSP</a>
            goes to an official source to check licenses or registrations for
            “authorized trading partner” status, that status would also be
            considered as self-asserted because it is based on a self-asserted
            identity. Therefore, one cannot confirm whether the party on the
            other end of a
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            transaction is an
            <a>ATP</a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            IAL2, the mid level of identity proofing, is suitable as an
            anchoring point for
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            requirements. Details are included in the next Section.
          </p>
          <p>
            IAL3, the highest level of identity proofing, is a higher degree of
            assurance that far exceeds
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            requirements. It would come at a substantially higher price, which
            is unnecessary for the
            <a>DSCSA</a>
            use case.

            One piece of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence IF the evidence’s issuing
            source, during its identity proofing event, confirmed the claimed

          The above rules apply to both the Company and its Representative.

        <p>
          The
          <a>NIST</a>
          standards are written to a broad variety of use cases, and therefore
          do not specify particular evidence needed under the DSCSA use case.
          The following definition of SUPERIOR evidence is excerpted from
          Section 5.2.1 of the
          <a>NIST</a>
          publication, just to provide an example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The issuing source of the evidence confirmed the claimed identity by
            following written procedures designed to enable it to have high
            confidence that the source knows the real-life identity of the
            subject. Such procedures are subject to recurring oversight by
            regulatory or publicly accountable institutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            The issuing source visually identified the applicant and performed
            further checks to confirm the existence of that person.
          </li>
          <li>
            The issuing process for the evidence ensured that it was delivered
            into the possession of the person to whom it relates.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence contains at least one reference number that uniquely
            identifies the person to whom it relates.
          </li>
          <li>
            The full name on the evidence must be the name that the person was
            officially known by at the time of issuance. Not permitted are
            pseudonyms, aliases, an initial for surname, or initials for all
            given names.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence contains a photograph of the person to whom it relates.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence contains a biometric template (of any modality) of the
            person to whom it relates.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence includes digital information, the information is
            protected using approved cryptographic or proprietary methods, or
            both, and those methods ensure the integrity of the information and
            enable the authenticity of the issuing source to be confirmed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence includes physical security features that require
            proprietary knowledge and proprietary technologies to be able to
            reproduce it.
          </li>
          <li>
            The evidence is unexpired.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because the
          <a>NIST</a>
          publication does not delineate particular evidence for the
          <a>DSCSA</a>
          use case, the writing of this conformance criteria publication
          required analyzing the
          <a>NIST</a>
          material against the
          <a>DSCSA</a>
          requirements, and researching due diligence processes of other
          identity proofing use cases. What follows is the result of this
          research and analysis process.

        <h2>Use of DEA Signing Certificate as Superior Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          Use of the DEA Signing Certificate alone meets the
          <a>NIST</a>
          standard of “One piece of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence” for Identity
          Assurance Level 2 (IAL2). The
          <a>CSP</a>
          validates the evidence directly with the issuing source through the
          certificate itself, which is a set of encrypted codes generated by the
          issuing source, which cannot be modified or replicated by another
          party. In addition, misrepresentation of a DEA Signing Certificate is
          a prima facie offense where no further fraud, misrepresentation, or
          unauthorized access is needed for the authorities to pursue action
          against an offender. It's one thing to lie to a [=Credential=] Issuer,
          but it's an entirely different level of risk to steal a DEA number.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DEA Signing Certificate not only validates the existence and
          identity of the company, but also validates the identity and authority
          of the representative. It is therefore the quickest and simplest
          method for complete identity proofing. Nothing from this point on in
          this Section 3 on Evidence for
          <a>Identity Proofing</a>
          is required if the DEA Signing Certificate is used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DEA reassures registrants that the use of the DEA Signing
          Certificate is perfectly acceptable for this purpose; it was foreseen
          and specifically allowed for by the DEA in their policy manual
          <a href="https://www.deaecom.gov/Ecom_CP.pdf">

              institutions and other registrants and must be used for the
              signing of electronic transaction orders. However, the use of CSOS

              relevant to environments where risks and consequences of data
              compromise are moderate. This may include transactions having
              substantial monetary value or risk of fraud, or involving access
              to private information where the likelihood of malicious access is
              substantial.

        <h2>Use of Company Documents as Strong or Fair Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          If a company does not have a DEA Signing Certificate, or chooses not
          to use it for identity proofing, the alternative is for them to gather
          and submit documents to the
          <a>CSP</a>
          to prove the existence and identity of the company. In addition, the
          applicant representing the company must submit documentation to prove
          their individual identity, as well as their authority to act on behalf
          of the company.
        </p>
        <p>
          IMPORTANT NOTE: Simply collecting documents or identification numbers
          does not constitute identity proofing. Due diligence is required to
          thoroughly validate the collected documents and identification
          numbers.

            As a first step to analyzing the company documents submitted by the
            applicant, the
            <a>CSP</a>
            SHOULD attempt to locate the company (using the company name given
            by the applicant) on the Better Business Bureau website (

            <a href="http://www.chamberofcommerce.com">chamberofcommerce.com</a>

          <h2>Company Address of Record</h2>
          <p>
            As specified in
            <a>NIST</a>
            SP800-63A section 4.4.1.6, the
            <a>CSP</a>
            SHALL validate the company address. The mailing address and phone
            number can be considered validated and confirmed by the processes in
            section 3.4.1 above if the address from one of those websites
            matches the address on the corporate document(s) submitted by the
            applicant. If they match, then the phone number from the
            above-mentioned website(s) can be considered as reliable as the
            mailing address for communication purposes. The ability to
            communicate with the applicant via phone (as opposed to mailing
            address) can expedite the identity proofing process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the company name and address of record cannot be verified through
            one of the websites listed in 3.4.1, then the
            <a>CSP</a>
            SHALL request from the applicant a copy of a recent (no more than 3
            months old) bank statement, utility bill, industry trade publication
            / letter, or other official piece of business mail that displays the
            company’s name and address. The mailing address from this document
            SHALL become the address of record. Note that this process does not
            allow a phone number to be verified as part of the address of
            record; thus, later steps of the due diligence process SHALL be
            transacted via mail, and SHALL NOT be transacted via phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way to expedite the communication process is to use a
            verified email address. This can be accomplished if the applicant
            has an email address within the company’s domain, and the
            <a>CSP</a>
            can reasonably ascertain that the domain belongs to the company
            through one of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the domain registration record is accessible and the owner
              information can be retrieved and confirmed;
            </li>
            <li>
              If the Chamber of Commerce website includes the company’s website
              address; or
            </li>
            <li>
              If the applicant provides a link to a page on the company’s
              website where the displayed company name and address (and phone
              number if present) match the address of record (see above)
              established thus far.

          <h2>Articles of Incorporation</h2>
          <p>
            A copy of the Articles of Incorporation can be viewed online and
            downloaded by anyone inside or outside the company; therefore, a
            copy of the document that looks exactly like the one on the website
            is considered by
            <a>NIST</a>
            to be WEAK evidence for proving identity because it does not meet
            the following criteria: “The issuing process for the evidence means
            that it can reasonably be assumed to have been delivered into the
            possession of the applicant.” However, a recent scan of the original
            document that looks slightly different (coloration, positioning of
            pages, and the like) from the one on the website would indicate that
            the original document is in the hands of the applicant, and it could
            qualify as STRONG depending on other factors, such as the name and
            address of the company’s “Registered Agent” on the document.
          </p>
          <p>
            The [=Credential=] Issuer SHALL go to the Secretary of State’s (or
            other authority’s) website and retrieve the publicly available copy
            of the document to compare it with the one submitted by the
            applicant. If the applicant IS also the Registered Agent, then this

          <h2>IRS Employer ID Number (EIN) Letter</h2>
          <p>
            The original EIN letter (form CP 575) was mailed by the IRS to the
            address specified on the application form SS-4, and is not
            downloadable from a website. Therefore, it would be quite difficult
            for someone not associated with the company to get a copy of this
            document. A company can get a replacement (147c letter) by knowing
            the EIN, name and address of business, and phone number of business;
            if the contact info has not changed since the original application
            for the EIN, the IRS will mail or fax it to the original contact. If
            the contact info has changed, you must file form 8822. Thus, it is
            reasonable to conclude that either the CP 575 copy or the 147c copy
            meets the following criteria: “The issuing process for the evidence
            means that it can reasonably be assumed to have been delivered into
            the possession of the applicant.”.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the document is faxed to the [=Credential=] Issuer from a fax
            number that matches the fax number on the document, it would qualify
            as one STRONG piece of evidence. If the document is uploaded, it
            would qualify as one STRONG piece of evidence if the address matches
            the applicant’s address. If the address doesn’t match, then it would
            be considered WEAK and unusable as evidence.

            A business license or permit, a notice from the IRS, or some
            official paperwork from a bank where the company opened an account
            might also have the company’s EIN on it. Such documents could be
            evaluated for consideration as FAIR evidence for proof of identity
            if the EIN Letter itself cannot be provided.

        <p>
          If the License Status is not interpreted to be “Active”, the company’s

          Note: With 150+ different assigned statuses across the state
          regulatory bodies (such as boards of pharmacy, etc.) the state

          The following triggers are given a 30 day grace period to be resolved.
          If the issue has not been resolved by the credential’s expiration
          date, the credential will remain valid for an additional 30 days

            company’s credentials, and operate illegally using the acquired
            company’s name. This possibility can be avoided by working with the

            Identity Credential monitoring had also previously issued an ATP
            credential, and that ATP credential has subsequently been revoked,
            it SHOULD trigger a review of the Identity Credential for possible
            implications.

            Revocation of credentials used by the company to prove identity
            during the original due diligence. For example, if a DEA Signing
            Certificate was originally used as proof of identity, and the DEA
            subsequently revoked the related DEA license, it SHALL trigger a
            review of the Identity Credential for possible implications.

        <h2>Identity Credential Audit Trail</h2>
        <p>
          The [=Credential=] Issuer SHALL keep detailed records of all Identity
          [=Credential=] issuance and monitoring activities for a period of not
          less than six (6) years. These detailed records are considered to be
          an audit trail that can be used in the event an investigation is
          conducted into credential-related activities of the credential owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Identity Credential issuance, the audit trail SHALL include copies
          of all original source data used by the [=Credential=] Issuer in
          conducting the due diligence to determine the existence and identity
          of the corporation, and the authority of the representative. In
          addition, all notes, decisions, and actions taken by the
          [=Credential=] Issuer as part of the approval process must be captured
          and stored as part of the audit trail. Finally, the digital signature
          of the individual who was responsible for conducting the due diligence
          must be applied to the issued credential to ensure that accountability
          can be tracked to an individual in the [=Credential=] Issuer’s
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Identity Credential monitoring, the audit trail SHALL include
          copies of any documents, or screenshots of any websites, that were
          reviewed to identify acquisitions, mergers, name changes, or address
          changes; all attributes associated with any other relevant revoked
          credentials; and all notes, decisions, and actions taken by the
          [=Credential=] Issuer as part of the monitoring process.
